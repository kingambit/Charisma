The objective of the CHARISMA project is to develop a non-proprietary, open-source software
platform to analyze and visualize NDE and other infrastructure data and fuse sensor data with
digital twin/BIM models. This open-source platform enables analysis and visualization codes and
algorithms to be easily shared and integrated into industry research, and help foster the integration
of asset inspection, management, and project delivery data for better asset management decision
making and facilitating stakeholder collaboration and participation to advance NDT/E and BIM
research.
